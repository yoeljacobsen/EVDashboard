# Debugging Real Car Connection Issue

## Problem Description
The EVDashboard application was connecting successfully to the DHU (Desktop Head Unit) emulator but failed to connect to a real car.

## Debugging Process

1.  **Initial Log Analysis:**
    *   Reviewed `logs.txt` from the morning of July 14, 2025.
    *   Observed `BLOCKED` interactions for `com.example.evdashboard` related to `AppsFilter`, suggesting potential permission or interaction issues with system services on a real device.

2.  **Git History Review:**
    *   Examined recent Git commits (last two weeks) to identify changes that might have introduced the issue.
    *   The commit `915bcb9` ("Fix: Address CAR_FUEL permission and EnergyLevel data handling") was identified as a prime suspect due to its direct involvement with `CAR_FUEL` permissions and related changes.

3.  **Analysis of Commit `915bcb9`:**
    *   This commit removed the `CAR_FUEL` permission from `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    *   It also modified `EVDashboardSession.java` to conditionally use mock data for `EnergyLevel` when running on Android Auto (ProjectedCarInfo) to prevent `CAR_FUEL` permission issues.
    *   The `minSdk` was changed from 28 to 30, and `androidx.car.app` dependency was updated from `1.4.0` to `1.7.0-rc01`. These changes, particularly the permission removal, were highly likely to cause issues on a real car where `CAR_FUEL` data might be expected or handled differently.

## Resolution

1.  **Revert of Commit `915bcb9`:**
    *   Attempted to revert commit `915bcb9` using `git revert 915bcb9`.
    *   The revert resulted in merge conflicts in `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and `app/src/main/java/com/example/evdashboard/EVDashboardSession.java`.

2.  **Conflict Resolution:**
    *   **`app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**: Manually resolved the conflict by removing the `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> parent of 915bcb9` markers, effectively restoring the permissions and metadata that were removed by the problematic commit.
    *   **`app/src/main/java/com/example/evdashboard/EVDashboardSession.java`**: Manually resolved the conflict by removing the `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> parent of 915bcb9` markers, restoring the original logic for handling `EnergyLevel` data without the conditional mock data usage introduced in the problematic commit.

3.  **Build and Install Debug Version:**
    *   After resolving conflicts, the `app/src/main/java/com/example/evdashboard/EVDashboardSession.java` file still contained syntax errors from the merge markers. These were manually removed.
    *   Attempted to build and install the debug version using `./gradlew installDebug`.
    *   Encountered `INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE` error, indicating a newer version was already on the device.
    *   Uninstalled the existing app using `./gradlew uninstallDebug`.
    *   Successfully built and installed the debug version using `./gradlew installDebug` after uninstalling the previous version.

## Next Steps
The app has been reinstalled on the connected phone with the reverted changes. The user needs to test the application on a real car to verify if the connection issue is resolved.
